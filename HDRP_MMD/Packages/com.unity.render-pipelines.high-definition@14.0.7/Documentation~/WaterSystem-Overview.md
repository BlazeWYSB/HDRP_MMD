# Capabilities of the Water System
The Water System simulates the behavior of water surfaces. It is adjustable and customizable.
A scene can support multiple water surfaces simultaneously.

## Water body types
HDRP provides for three water surface types: **Pool**, **River**, and **Ocean, Sea, or Lake**. The last two of these include multi-band simulation properties to provide larger and more complex wave patterns.

## Underwater rendering
It is possible to view water surfaces from below if you enable the **Underwater** option.

## Wind and current
Wind and swell or ripple properties combine with **Current** values to determine the motion of the [water simulation](WaterSystem-simulation.md).

## Surface foam
**River** and **Ocean, Sea, or Lake** surfaces support surface foam. You can adjust the amount of foam, its smoothness and texture, mask it, and adjust it based on the **Distant Wind Speed**.

##  Caustics
You can adjust caustic resolution for all surface types, and specify which **Simulation Band** Unity should use to generate the caustic texture for  **River** and **Ocean, Sea, or Lake** surface types.

## Material properties
It is possible to adjust the **Smoothness**, **Refraction**, and light **Scattering** qualities of a water surface.

## ShaderGraph
For more in-depth water Material customizations, you can use [the water ShaderGraph](WaterSystem-ShaderGraph.md).

## Masking
You can assign custom masks to attenuate or supress ripples, swells, and foam on specific portions of a water surface. You can also use them to adjust decal and light layers.
## Scripting
It is possible to create [scripts that interact with the Water System](WaterSystem-scripting.md), to imitate buoyancy, for example.

## Limitations and caveats
The Water System does not currently support:
* Breaking waves on shorelines
* Holes
* Views from the side (as in an aquarium)
* Rejection (to keep the water surface out of hollow objects, such as boats)

Foam and caustics are monochrome.
### Feature compatibility
The Water System is compatible with most HDRP and Unity features, with some specific exceptions.
#### Lighting
You cannot bake lighting for a water surface.
#### Volumetric Clouds
Water renders in front of Volumetric Clouds if you view it from above.
#### Lens Flare
Water surfaces do not occlude Lens Flares. This produces an unnatural effect when you look upward at a Lens Flare from underwater.
#### Dynamic resolution and antialiasing
HDRP's water implementation does not use motion vectors. This means that techniques like [Deep learning super sampling](deep-learning-super-sampling-in-hdrp.md), and [temporal antialiasing](Anti-Aliasing.md) produce blurry results with a lot of ghosting if you use them with water. [Multisample anti-aliasing](Anti-Aliasing.html#MSAA) is entirely incompatible with water, however.


#### Raytracing caveats
Although water surfaces can receive [Ray-Traced Reflections](Ray-Traced-Reflections.md), they cannot contribute to them. This means if you hold up a mirror to a water surface, the water does not reflect in the mirror, for example.

#### Reflection and refraction
Water surfaces do not affect transparent refractive objects.
Also, although [Screen Space Reflection](Override-Screen-Space-Reflection.md) is compatible with water surfaces, it does not fall back to [Reflection Probes](Reflection-in-HDRP.md) underwater.

#### Decals
HDRP provides limited decal support for water surfaces. Global opacity controls the strength of the decal influence. Also, certain [Decal Shader](Decal-Shader.md) Surface Options do not work with water surfaces:
* **Affect Metal**
* **Affect Ambient Occlusion**
* **Affect Emission**

Also, **Affect Base Color** only produces monochromatic output.
